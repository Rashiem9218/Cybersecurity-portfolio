 Jarrett Wilson
Orangeburg SC
I grew to develop an interest in IT from my curiosity in computers and how the software, hardware and data are managed
My aspirations are to master learning how to code as eventually becoming a software developer
I take great integrity in protecting my securities license which is called a Series 63 License, this helps me with transacting seecurities such as a brokerage dealer and other aspects of soliciting such as trade options as well as stock legally.
